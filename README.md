## Boids.kt 

A 3D Boids simulation implementation with Kotlin/JS
 
Inspired by [Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model](https://team.inria.fr/imagine/files/2014/10/flocks-hers-and-schools.pdf) by Craig Reynolds

 
 
Early work in progress but all the basic steering behaviors (separation, cohesion, alignment) and basic collision avoidance have already been implemented
